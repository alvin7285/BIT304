          <h3 class = "storyTitle">The Story Behind Jinjang</h3>
          <h3 class = "story">The entire housing was built on the city’s
            landfilled rubbish dump. It is currently notorious for the high
            crime rate, drug abuse, gang fights and conflicts. A harbor for
            drug addicts, alcoholics, gangsters, prostitutes and petty criminals.
            Jinjang Utara is littered with dilapidated rumah transit (supposed
            to be temporary housing). Currently, housing more than 2000 people.
            These are forgotten people who became disillusioned and embittered.
            The inhabitants waited for 40 years to date, to be relocated to
            their new residence under Projek Perumahan (PPR) which has yet to
            happen. This is 38 years later than the promised duration by the
            government. Even if they are offered low cost housing tomorrow,
            they will not be able to afford it as they can hardly afford
            the RM40 per month rent even now. The average combined income
            per month for each family is less than RM1000.<br><br>

            The integrity of the rumah transit is questionable because they
            were not built to last. This poses a health and safety hazard for
            the family staying under the roof of each unit. The occupants have
            grown over the years to include three generations with an average
            of ten people in each unit. Each unit is cramped in a
            480-square-feet space for the entire family of over 10 pax each.<br>

            <br>The children in Jinjang Utara have been growing up in a poverty
            stricken environment. Some were abandoned by their parents or are
            neglected in an environment of abject poverty. Violence is rampant
            in this place. Teenagers are at risk of being recruited by gangs.
            With their home so broken and crowded, the teenagers have no place
            to turn to. The gangs offered financial and communal support/relief,
            including a sense of belonging.<br><br>

            Jonathan Ambalagan and Mary Ramamoothy started the community work
            and have been reaching out to the children of Jinjang Utara for the
            past 17 years. It is their life mission to see the community
            transformed and changed through helping the children - one child
            at a time. The chief focus is on education and social concern
            activities. They conduct weekly outdoor activities to instill
            moral values in children. Over 100 children attend their session
            every week. Over the years, many of these children have progressed
            to complete their secondary education. Few are even completing
            their college education through the sponsorship of kind benefactors
            like HELP Education Group.<br><br>

            Jonathan and Mary make home visits weekly to know each family’s
            respective needs. In the process, they are supporting some of
            the families’ need such as education (school bus), groceries,
            school supplies, etc. Because of the financial burden, many of
            these children are undernourished and some are even deprived of
            food for many days. They then have to survive on occasional
            leftovers offered by kind neighbors.<br><br>

            The children are constantly subjected to danger of bad influence,
            perversion and exploitation daily under such conditions.
            Occasionally, Jonathan and Mary will be called for counselling,
            as the men are thrown in jail, taken into drug rehab, youths
            arrested for fights or drug possession, etc. The work is immense
            with never ending challenges.
